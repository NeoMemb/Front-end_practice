# My ToDo App
### I got some help from chatgpt for this particular project
> When the user types a task and clicks "Add":

 - Get the task value 

 - Save it to an array in memory.

 - Save the updated array in localStorage.

 - Display all tasks on the page.

 - When the page loads:

 - Read the saved task list from localStorage.

 - Show it in the DOM ("ul" tag).

 - When a delete button is clicked:

 - Remove that task from the array.

 - Update localStorage.

 - Update the DOM.


### I created two branches for now:
- main (For learning: with the help of chatgpt hint)
- NewFeature: Adding new features like; the wonderful enter key action, and adding done task.
